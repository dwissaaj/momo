# A Fresh UI Kit

[Momo logo]("/Momo.png")

For my personal project, since Fresh Deno don't have built in UI library I need
to make one, either could be a disaster or not I don't know since my coding
skills is sucks

Since I new to engineering I dont have knowledge about how to make the
components as a package in deno, not only this fresh limited components only
avalaible with `/island` folder only so for now just copy paste the code, sorry
